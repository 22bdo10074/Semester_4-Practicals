# Semester_4-Practicals

### [Design and analysis of algorithm](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/tree/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm):
DAA practicals aim to reinforce theoretical knowledge gained in lectures with hands-on implementation experience. 
They help students develop practical problem-solving skills, algorithmic intuition, and 
the ability to analyze and optimize algorithms for various computational tasks.
