### [Git and Github experiments](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/tree/Git-and-git-hub-practical):
Git is a version control system that helps you manage your project's source code history, and 
GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features. 
Here's a basic walkthrough of some practicals you can try with Git and GitHub:

### [Experiment-1](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/EXP1-GIT/README.md):
In this experiment we are going to Install Git and creating repository.
### [Experiment-2](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-1.2/README.md):
In this experiment we will Creating branches by using git command and also by directly creating brances on github.
### [Experiment-3](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/worksheet-1.3/README.md):
In this experiment we will creating and exploring Pull request.

In this experiment we will perform Creation of Forks on GitHub.
### [Experiment-7]():
