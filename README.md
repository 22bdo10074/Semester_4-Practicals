# Semester_4-Practicals
## Here is implementation of all the subject practicals like git and git-hub, agile practices, Design and analysis of algorithms.

### [Git and Github experiments](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/tree/Git-and-git-hub-practical):
Git is a version control system that helps you manage your project's source code history, and 
GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features. 
Here's a basic walkthrough of some practicals you can try with Git and GitHub:

### [Experiment-1](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/EXP1-GIT/README.md):

### [Experiment-2](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-1.2/README.md):
In this experiment we will Creating branches by using git command and also by directly creating brances on github.

### [Experiment-3](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/worksheet-1.3/README.md):
In this experiment we will creating and exploring Pull request.

In this experiment we will Merge Pull Request and Update local repository on GitHub

### [Experiment-6](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-2.3/README.md):
In this experiment we will perform Creation of Forks on GitHub.

### [Experiment-7](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-2.4/README.md):
In this experiment we will perform git merge conflicts and resolving git merge conflicts.

### [Experiment-8](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-3.1/README.md):
In this experiment we wil compare the changes in the repository.

### [Experiment-9](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-3.2/README.md):
In this experiment we will understanding the various reset modes.

### [Experiment-10](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Git-and-git-hub-practical/Worksheet-3.3/README.md):
In this experiment we will work with your history in git.



### [Design and analysis of algorithm](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/tree/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm):
DAA practicals aim to reinforce theoretical knowledge gained in lectures with hands-on implementation experience. 
They help students develop practical problem-solving skills, algorithmic intuition, and 
the ability to analyze and optimize algorithms for various computational tasks.

### [Experiment-6](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm/Experiment%206%20DAA.pdf):
Here is the Implementation of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Dynamic Programming.
### [Experiment-7](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/blob/Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithm/Experiment%207%20DAA.pdf):
To Perform Matrix Chain Multiplication Problem (MCM) using Dynamic Programming.



 

### [Agile_practices](https://github.com/22bdo10074/Semester_4-Practicals/tree/Agile_practices):
Agile practicals provide us with valuable experiential learning opportunities, allowing them to apply Agile principles and practices in a controlled environment, develop teamwork and communication skills, 
and gain insights into the challenges and benefits of Agile methodologies in real-world projects.
