# Experiment 1
## Mapping Agile Development approach with Software Development.

Aim:  Mapping Agile Development approach with Software Development.

### 5.1 theory: 
Agile refers to a set of principles and values in software development that emphasize adaptability, collaboration, flexibility, and iterative progress. The Agile methodology prioritizes delivering working software in small, frequent increments, enabling teams to respond effectively to changing requirements and customer feedback.

Agile Values:

Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools: Emphasizes the importance of teamwork, communication, and collaboration among team members rather than solely relying on tools or processes.
Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation: Prioritizes delivering functioning software that meets the customer's needs over extensive documentation.
Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation: Encourages continuous collaboration with customers throughout the development process to ensure the delivered product meets their requirements.
Responding to Change over Following a Plan: Embraces changes in requirements and priorities, allowing teams to adapt and respond to evolving needs.


Agile Principles:

The Agile Manifesto also includes twelve principles that guide Agile development, including:

•	Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development.
•	Delivering working software frequently, in short iterations.
•	Business and development teams working together daily throughout the project.
•	Building projects around motivated individuals and giving them the environment and support they need.
•	Reflecting regularly on how to become more effective, then adjusting behaviour accordingly.
•	
Various Agile methodologies (such as Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean, etc.) have evolved based on these Agile principles, offering specific frameworks, practices, and techniques to implement Agile principles effectively.


### 5.2:  Agile Methodology vs Waterfall Methodology in Project Management:

### Agile Project Management:
Flexibility: The Agile methodology is flexible, allowing the project team to make changes and adjustments to the project in the middle of the project.

Efficiency: The Agile methodology is efficient, as it allows the project team to deliver working products in small, incremental stages.

Client Involvement: The Agile methodology involves the client throughout the project, which can lead to better understanding and satisfaction.

Agile has a faster feedback cycle.

Agile will identify problems early.

Agile has a higher potential for customer satisfaction.

Agile has better visibility and accountability.

Agile makes the dedicated teams to make productivity better time by time.

###  Waterfall Project Management:
Easy to Understand: The waterfall methodology is easy to understand as it follows a linear sequential process that makes it easy for the team to understand the project requirements.

Predictability: The waterfall methodology provides predictability, as the project’s scope, budget, and timeline are determined at the beginning of the project.

Documentation: The waterfall methodology requires extensive documentation of the project’s requirements, which can help in future maintenance and updates.

The Design phase is more methodical and well-structured before any software works on the same.

clear project phase helps to clearly define the dependency of the team’s work.

### Conclusion: 
Choosing between Agile and Waterfall methodologies depends on various factors such as project requirements, scope, customer involvement, and the level of flexibility needed:
•	For Predictability and Stability: Waterfall may be suitable for projects with well-defined, stable requirements and clear project scope.
•	For Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile is preferable for projects where requirements are likely to evolve, and rapid adaptation to change is crucial. It is especially effective in dynamic and uncertain environments.
